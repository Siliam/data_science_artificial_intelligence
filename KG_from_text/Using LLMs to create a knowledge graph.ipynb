This diffusion of blue light in all directions gives the sky its blue appearance.\n",

      "The reason why we perceive the sky as blue, rather than some other color, is due to the way our eyes and brains process visual information. The human eye has cells in the retina that are sensitive to different wavelengths of light, with the most sensitive cells responding to light in the blue range (around 450-495 nanometers). This means that we are more likely to notice and perceive the blue light that is scattered throughout the atmosphere, rather than other colors.\n",
